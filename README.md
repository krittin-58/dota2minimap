dota2minimap
============

Renders a html dota2 minimap showing building status at the end of a match

There are two ways to use it.

1. load minimap.php with a valid match_id argument e.g. minimap.php?match_id=656600486
2. use the simple form on index.php and provide a valid match_id

It should be easy enough to integrate it into a dota2 site that already handles parsing match details from the dota2 api. The elegant part is that the html is responsive and the minimap will look nice in any size viewport.
